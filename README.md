# Husky
Husky is a BSP Extractor for Call of Duty. It can rip the raw vertex/face data to a file that can be opened in software such as Autodesk Maya (currently only OBJ). It also includes UVs and material names, and in the future, will export other data such as static models, dynamic models, etc.

### Supported Games

* Call of Duty: World at War
* Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
* Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
* Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
* Call of Duty: Ghosts

**Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 will never be supported, for obvious reasons**

All BSP data extracted using Husky is property of the developers, etc. Husky simply parses the data out, what you do with the data is your reponsibility.

Some of the exported models can get pretty big. While all have loaded in Maya with no issue, make sure to have available resources available to load and view them.
